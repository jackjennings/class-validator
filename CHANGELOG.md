  This caused breaking change, if you used the `IsUrl` decorator to validate `localhost` as a valid url, from now you must use the `require_tld: false` option

  ```typescript
  @IsUrl({ require_tld: false})
  url: string;
  ```

* added `@IsInstance` decorator and `validator.isInstance(value, target)` method.
* changed `@IsNumber` decorator has been changed to `@IsNumber(options: IsNumberOptions)`
* added option to strip unknown properties \(`whitelist: true`\)
* added option to throw error on unknown properties \(`forbidNonWhitelisted: true`\)
* added `@Allow` decorator to prevent stripping properties without other constraint

#### Fixes

* fixed issue with `@IsDateString` now it allow dates without fraction seconds to be set
* fixed issue with `@IsDateString` now it allow dates without with timezones to be set
* `@ValidateNested` correctly generates validation error on non object and non array values

## 0.6.7

#### Fixes

* fixed issue with `@ValidateNested` when nested property is not defined and it throw an error \(\#59\)

## 0.6.5

#### Fixes

* fixed bugs with `@IsUrl`, `@IsEmail` and several other decorators

## 0.6.4

## 0.6.0 \[BREAKING CHANGE\]

#### Features

* breaking change with `@ValidateNested` on arrays: Validator now groups the validation errors by sub-object, rather than them all being grouped together. See \#32 for a demonstration of the updated structure.
* added `@ValidateIf` decorator, see conditional validation in docs.

## 0.5.0 \[BREAKING CHANGE\]

#### Features

* async validations must be marked with `{ async: true }` option now.

  This is optional, but it helps to determine which decorators are async to prevent their execution in `validateSync` method.

* added `validateSync` method that performs non asynchronous validation and ignores validations that marked with `async: true`.
* there is a breaking change in `registerDecorator` method. Now it accepts options object.
